# secure-app

This application is the playground for proof of concepts concerning application security.
It contains approaches for the following

..* Configured application using Spring security 
..* Emulates whats needed to emulate a credential being created in a WebSEAL EAI scenario
..* Redirects the main homepage to the Angular 2 quickstart application. The purpose of this was to try seperate out the UI from the server side code.
